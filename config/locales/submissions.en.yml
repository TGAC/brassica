        You will also be able to provide data ownership and provenance information.</br>
        Submitted data is by default private. This means that it is only visible and accessible to you.
        You can change this at the last step of the submission or any time after the submission. Once this is done, the
        data will be accessible for all users of the Portal.

        Fill out the provenance section in detail so other users can accredit you properly.
        For more information, please visit the documentation pages.</br>
        For detailed instructions regarding the data uploading process
        please consult the <a href="/manuals/upload_%{type}_submission.pdf">manual</a>.
        Further contextual help will be provided at each of the following steps:
      population: |
        The following process allows you to submit a detailed description of your
        Brassica population. Apart from species information you may indicate
        the parent Brassica lines and the list of (possibly new) plant lines
        connected with this population.</br>
        For your convenience use <b><a href='%{plant_lines_template_url}'>the template</a></b>
        in a CSV format. Download it, leave the header (the first line) intact, and paste your data, in columns,
        below the header. Please do not remove any columns even if you leave them empty. See template content and Step 3 for details.
      trial: |
        With Trail submission you are able to upload new trait scoring information to BIP.
        The process lets you describe trial conditions and environment, to indicate
        what traits were scored and how, and finally to upload the list of scoring.

    steps:
      population:
        step01:
          heading: Basic information.
          body: Provide a unique name and a description of your population. Select the population type.
        step02:
          heading: Taxonomy.
          body: Choose the species and the origin of the population you are submitting.
        step03:
          heading: Plant lines.
          body: |
            Define the list of plant lines connected with the submitted population.
            You can either use the CSV file template (suitable for larger populations) or manual form submission.
        step04:
          heading: Provenance.
          body: Identify the owner of the submitted data and describe its provenance.
      trial:
        step01:
          heading: Trial information.
          body: Provide detailed description about the performed plant trial. Give as much information as possible.
        step02:
          heading: Traits.
          body: Choose plant traits that were scored in the course of this trial, or define new trait descriptors.
          new_trait_descriptor_attributes:
            category: Trait category
            units_of_measurements: Unit of measurement
          new_trait_descriptor_attribute_hints:
            category: Select, or provide, the category of trait.
            units_of_measurements: Select, or write down, the unit of measurement when scoring this trait.
        step03:
          heading: Scoring template design.
          body: |
            Provide us with information important for the scoring template design. The template will then be created
            automatically, in order to help you upload your trait data correctly.
        step04:
          heading: Scoring.
          body: Upload tabular list of scores given to plants per each trait scored.
        step05:
          heading: Trial layout.
          body: If available, please upload an image of the layout of your trial
        step06:
          heading: Provenance.
          body: Identify the owner of the submitted data and describe its provenance.
