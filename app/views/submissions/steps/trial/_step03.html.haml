    BIP service assumes that each row in the trait scoring sheet, that you are going
    to submit, represents a so-called
    %b plant scoring unit.
    For raw data it may simply be an individual plant in your experiment. For processed data
    a plant scoring unit may represent a set of plants, related to each other in some way. For each
    scoring unit we will ask you to mandatory provide
    %b plant accession
    information.

  %p
    In case you would like to check what plant accessions are currently registered in BIP, please
    use the
    = link_to 'plant accessions table view', data_tables_path(model: 'plant_accessions'), target: '_blank'
    (you may filter data in that table with the
    %b Search
    text field).

  %p
    If you submit raw data, you will have an option to submit technical replicate readings as
    well as design factors (for instance, ordinal numbers for plots, reps and so forth).

  = label_tag "Used genetic material origin"

  %small.help-block
    Per each plant scoring unit submitted, the source of genetic material should be provided. It may either be a
    %b plant line
    or a
    %b plant variety (cultivar).
    This choice depends on the type of experiment you are conducting. You should select the
    %b Plant lines
    option if you
    %ul
      %li created new genetic material (using, for instance, crossing or mutagenesis) in the course of your project,
      %li or you use former plant line genetic material which is not (yet) recognized as a variety or a cultivar.
    In other cases you should probably select the the
    %b Plant varieties
    option.

        If you are using
        %i technical replicates
        in your experiment, please set the number of replicates you are scoring per trait. Leaving
        the value at
        %b 1
        means you are not using technical replicates for a given trait.

      %p
        Please select the appropriate statistical design factors suitable for your experimental setup from
        the drop-down fields. Start by selecting the
        %b highest design factor first
        and proceed with the next ones in
        %b decreasing
        size.

      %p
        If your factors are not present in the list provided, please add them manually. While creating new
        factors, please make sure you comply with the rule to submit them in decreasing size, so with the
        highest missing factor (e.g. treatment) first, to lowest missing factor (e.g. plot).
        You are able to mix both predefined factors, from the drop-down list, and your own factor names.
