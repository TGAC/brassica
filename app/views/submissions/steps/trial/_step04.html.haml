      Please review the above parsing logs. If there were any critical errors during the process,
      the red section will try to give some hints regarding their nature. You may then try to fix
      the file accordingly, delete the current upload and re-upload the fixed file.

    %p
      Otherwise, if you think the parsing went properly, use the <b>NEXT</b> button to confirm
      these changes and proceed with further steps of submission.
